// Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

// Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.: (Input --> Output)

function rowSumOddNumbers(n) {
	return n * n * n
}

//this solution is a more pattern recognition, math based type of question. 
//At least, to get a cleaner solution it is.
